**Abstract**

The war in Ukraine has caused many people to flee their country. 
That is why we study to what extend the attitude on Reddit changes towards migration within Europe before and after the war in Ukraine. We use Sentiment Analysis to analyse the attitude on reddit and found that there is a significant (/textit{p=.0454} ) change in attitude. We compared our results with previous collected survey data from the ESS. Despite limitations considering this method and the use of data, we conclude that there is a positive change in attitude towards migration in Europe.
